# DFS and BFS Pathfinding in Graphs

This Python script implements **Depth-First Search (DFS)** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to find paths in a graph.

## Description

- **DFS (Depth-First Search)** explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It may not find the shortest path but is useful in scenarios where a solution needs to be found quickly.
- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)** explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It guarantees finding the shortest path in terms of transitions.
